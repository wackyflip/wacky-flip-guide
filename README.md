# 🔄 Wacky Flip: Physics Mayhem Unleashed
Welcome to the [Wacky Flip](https://wackyflip.org/) Developer Showcase, a repository dedicated to the game that’s flipping expectations in 2025. Whether you’re a curious coder, a game mechanic enthusiast, or just hooked on hilarious ragdoll physics, this repo dives deep into how Wacky Flip makes chaos feel so good.

## 🎮 # About Wacky Flip
Wacky Flip is a wild physics-based stunt game created by 1Games, designed to make you laugh, retry, and cheer in equal measure. Your mission? Launch, spin, bounce, and flop your way across absurd obstacle courses—all while trying to land on your feet (or not).

Built on responsive ragdoll mechanics and unpredictably fun level design, Wacky Flip delivers non-stop replayability with:

- 🌀 Dynamic character physics

- 🏗️ Multi-layered environments

- 💥 Explosive slow-mo fails

- 🎯 Skill-based landings for high scores


## 🧩 How It Works
This repo includes insights into:

Game physics logic

Animation trigger points

Collision and rebound handling

Random event scripting

### Each stunt is generated using body part physics + variable gravity. There's no fixed animation—every flip is uniquely simulated.

- 🚧 Levels That Challenge Logic
- 🚜 Farm Rampage – Hay bales, tractors, and fences galore.

- 🎡 Carnival Chaos – Bounce off cotton candy stands and dodgy rides.

- 🧱 Skyscraper Stack – One wrong move and it's a long fall down.

- 🛶 River Launch – Flip across canoes and floating barrels.

- 🛠️ Project Goals
This GitHub project is designed to:

Share game design documentation for indie devs.

Offer community-sourced modding tools (in progress).

Provide animation debug tools for learning ragdoll systems.
